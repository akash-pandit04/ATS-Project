# 🚑 ATS for Path Clearance and Detection of Ambulance

This project simulates an intelligent traffic management system that detects approaching ambulances using video footage, tracks their GPS locations, and clears traffic signals virtually to provide a green corridor to the hospital — **entirely through software**, without any physical hardware.

## 📌 Project Objective

To design a **virtual traffic system** where:
- Ambulance is **automatically detected** using computer vision models with the combination of YOLOv5 and OpenCV. 
- Its **live GPS location** is simulated and sent to a Flask server.
- **Traffic signals** are managed to **clear the path** for the ambulance.
- All modules are integrated to demonstrate a working prototype in software.

## ⚙️ Approch/Logic Used

- 🔍 YOLOv5 Model (for ambulance detection)
- 🐍 Python 3.9 for Script 
- 🧠 OpenCV Computer Vision for Detection from video.
- 🌐 Flask app (for frontend/backend)
- 🗺️ Folium / Map APIs (for map path clearance)
- 🖥️ Tkinter / PyQt (for GUI traffic simulation)

## 🚦 Modules Overview

| Module | File | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `ambulance_detector.py` | Detect ambulance using YOLOv5 in video footage |
| 2 | `gps_simulation.py` | Simulates GPS coordinates and sends to backend |
| 3 | `flask_server/app.py` | Receives GPS data and triggers traffic signal updates |
| 4 | `traffic_signal_gui.py` | Shows visual traffic signals that respond to ambulance |
| 5 | `route_clearance_map/` | Simulates map-based path clearance visualization |
| 6 | `integrated_demo/` | Integrates all modules to show the final system |
